## OpenTelemetry Capstone

### What You’ll Learn Today
In this lab we'll utilize multiple OpenTelemetry Collectors to collect application traces/spans, log records, and metric data points generated by OpenTelemetry, from a Kubernetes cluster and ship them to Dynatrace.  This is a capstone lab that utilizes the concepts of the previous Kubernetes OpenTelemetry labs.

Lab tasks:
1. Deploy 4 OpenTelemetry Collectors
2. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector service pipeline for data enrichment
3. Analyze metrics, traces, and logs in Dynatrace
4. Observe OpenTelemetry Collector health in Dynatrace
